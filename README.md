🌿 AyurLife – Integrated Ayurvedic & Herbal Medicine Mobile App
AyurLife is a mobile-first, API-driven digital platform designed to modernize and integrate Sri Lanka’s Ayurvedic and herbal medicine ecosystem.
The system connects patients, doctors, herbal suppliers, medicine producers, wellness centers, and administrators into a single, secure digital solution.

📌 Project Overview
Traditional Ayurvedic practices in Sri Lanka rely heavily on manual records, informal supply chains, and disconnected stakeholders.
AyurLife addresses these challenges by introducing a centralized mobile application with a RESTful backend, improving efficiency, transparency, and accessibility while preserving traditional medical knowledge.

🎯 Objectives

Digitize patient records and Ayurvedic prescriptions
Enable secure appointment booking and symptom tracking
Create a digital herbal supply and inventory network
Preserve traditional medicine formulations in digital form
Improve trust through doctor verification and knowledge moderation
Provide a scalable and user-friendly mobile solution
